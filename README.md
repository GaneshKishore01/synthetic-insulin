# **Description**

## **What it is**
Tradinitonal biochemical productions rely on Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast), in which they break open the yeast cells to take seperate the biochemical product from the yeast. This step however is monetarily and financialy costly since the yeast cells have to be replenished. Also the biochemical produce is produced in an centralized manner ie. biochemical produce needs to be transported to where it needs, which costs money and makes it inaccessible for people living in secluded areas.

## **How it works**
- **Insulin Production:**  
  Insulin produced as a fusion protein(F.P.) which leverages TSS1 secretion system of E.coli to secrete F.P. from the cell in a continious manner without breaking it
